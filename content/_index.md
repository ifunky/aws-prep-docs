# Welcome!

This site has been built in preparation for Dan's AWS interview having been given the following brief:

> 
>
> *The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate your ability to create a simple system on the Amazon Web Services Platform. You’ll create an account, launch a server and configure it with some content. Once you’ve built and tested the server, you’ll create an image and share it so we can see the results of your work.* 



Please use the menu on the right to drill down into:

- "TAM Assignment" - How I built the server and my tech stack choices.
- "This Site!" - An alternative approach to the solution, simple documentation (using the `JAM Stack`) and AWS Amplify



I look forward to chatting with you soon :-)

Thanks

Dan
