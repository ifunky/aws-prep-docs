**How I Built My Account**

The first step in the process was to create the necessary AWS infrastructure.

**Technology Choice**

Hashicorp Terraform

**Why?**

Most of my customers request me to use Terraform as a standard so I have learnt Terraform and to further my knowledge I use it for my own personal projects which has resulted in some open source projects that my clients use.

**AWS Well Architected Framework**

I really like the Operational Excellence Pillar as aspects of this draw apon my development experience in terms of creating infrastructure as code and CI/CD pipelines.



**Tools Used**

Terraform Generattor https://github.com/ifunky/terraform-generator

This is a scafolding tool that I created that can be used to:

- Create best practice structured Terraform modules
- Create AWS accounts in line with the `AWS Landing Zone Pattern`
